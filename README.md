## Project Descrption 
Todo List is an application specially built to keep track of errands or tasks that need to be done. This application will be like a task keeper where the user would be able to enter the tasks that they need to do. Once they are done with their tasks they can also remove them from the list.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
## User  Stories
- As a user, I should be able to add my to-do to the list and save it in local storage.
- As a user, I should be able to edit my to-dos.
- As a user, I should be able to remove any to-do from my list (remove it from local storage).
- As a user, I can still have my list even if I close the browser window.
